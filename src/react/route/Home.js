			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			
			<p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</p>
			
			<p>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
			
			<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
			
			<p>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
			
			<p>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</p>
