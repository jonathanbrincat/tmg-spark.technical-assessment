			<p>Save me, Jeebus. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
			
			<p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
			
			<p>Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
