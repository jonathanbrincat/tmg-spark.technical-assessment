			<h2>These are Simpsons quotes if you hadn't noticed&hellip;</h2>

			<p>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
			
			<p>Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</li>
				<li>Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</li>
				<li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</p>
